## '1e0a': A Computational Approach to Rhythm Training

This repository holds code for an automated learning application to promote the learning and assessment of basic rhythmic patterns. 
The application is built to mimic a teacher student relationship where, the subsequent levels of pattern complexity is generated based on the
performance accuracy of the user on the current pattern. Assessment is made over the statistical deviations calculated from the temporal assessment of a user's performance, and compared with the generated pattern. The accuracy of performance of the user forms the feedback to the user.
